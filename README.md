## Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/automateyournetwork/netclaw.git
cd netclaw
./scripts/install.sh          # interactive installer — pick exactly what you want
```

> **Run it as your normal user — not with `sudo`.** Under sudo, OpenClaw's config, your API keys, and all skills land in `/root/.openclaw` where your own `openclaw` can't see them. The installer refuses to run under sudo and instead asks before each specific command that needs root.

The installer opens an interactive TUI (pure bash — no dialog/whiptail needed): pick an install profile, then optionally fine-tune the exact MCP server list in an arrow-key checklist (Space to toggle, `a` all, `n` none). Only what you select gets installed.

**Install profiles:**

| Profile | What you get |
|---------|--------------|
| **Recommended** | Curated starter set: pyATS, NetBox, ServiceNow, GAIT audit trail, Chrome DevTools, nmap, diagrams, utilities |
| **Custom** | Hand-pick from every component in a categorized checklist |
| **Everything** | The classic full install — every component |
| **Cisco** | pyATS, ACI, ISE, Catalyst Center, Meraki, SD-WAN, CML, FMC, RADKit, ThousandEyes |
| **Multivendor** | Cisco + Juniper, Arista, Aruba, F5, NetBox, Nautobot |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP, Cloudflare, Terraform, Vault, GitHub |
| **Security** | ISE, FMC, Panorama, FortiManager, Check Point, Zscaler, Claroty, nmap, CVE |
| **Labs** | CML, ContainerLab, Batfish, protocol peering, N2N federation, SuzieQ |
| **Observability** | Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog, Splunk, PagerDuty, ThousandEyes, Kubeshark |
| **Minimal** | pyATS + audit trail + core utilities |

Scripted / non-interactive installs:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --profile recommended        # any profile, no TUI
./scripts/install.sh --components "pyats netbox"  # exact component list
./scripts/install.sh --all                        # everything
./scripts/install.sh --list                       # see all components & profiles
```

### Agent runtime — OpenClaw, Hermes, or NemoClaw

NetClaw runs on top of an agent runtime. **OpenClaw** is the default and the
fully-integrated path. You can instead run NetClaw on
**[Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)** (Nous Research's
self-improving agent), or attach to an existing OpenClaw already running
inside a **NemoClaw** sandbox (`--runtime nemoclaw`). The interactive installer
asks which runtime to use; scripted installs pick it explicitly:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --runtime hermes --profile recommended
NETCLAW_RUNTIME=hermes ./scripts/install.sh --all
NETCLAW_RUNTIME=nemoclaw NEMOCLAW_SANDBOX=dcloud-nemoclaw ./scripts/install.sh --profile recommended
```

| | OpenClaw (default) | Hermes | NemoClaw |
|---|---|---|---|
| Install | `npm install -g openclaw@latest` | `curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh \| bash` | Do **not** install OpenClaw. Attach to the existing sandbox gateway. |
| Binary | `openclaw` | `hermes` (`~/.local/bin`) | `nemoclaw` (sandbox CLI on the host that owns the sandbox) |
| State dir | `~/.openclaw/` | `~/.hermes/` (override with `$HERMES_HOME`) | `~/.netclaw/` (manifest + `gateway.env` only) |
| Config | `openclaw.json` | `config.yaml` (`mcp_servers:`) | `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` + `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` |
| Skills | `workspace/skills/` | `skills/` | `nemoclaw $NEMOCLAW_SANDBOX skill install <skill-dir>` |
| Onboard | `openclaw onboard --install-daemon` | `hermes setup` + `hermes gateway install` | Already onboarded in the sandbox — skipped |
| Talk to it | `openclaw tui` | `hermes --tui` / `hermes chat` | NetClaw HUD against the published gateway |

NemoClaw does **not** start a host `openclaw gateway` and does **not** copy
host stdio `mcpServers` from `config/openclaw.json` into the sandbox. The HUD
reads `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` / `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` from the environment or
from a gitignored `~/.netclaw/gateway.env` (mode `0600`). Never put the token
in git, README examples, or source.

The remote sandbox still needs the HUD chat API enabled (TUI does not):

```bash
nemoclaw dcloud-nemoclaw exec -- openclaw config set gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled true
```

NemoClaw attach operator runbooks:

- [Start NetClaw on a NemoClaw sandbox](docs/NEMOCLAW-START-NETCLAW.md)
- [Fix `https://inference.local` doctor failures](docs/NEMOCLAW-INFERENCE-LOCAL.md)

On a Hermes install the installer still deploys the same **MCP servers, skills,
SOUL, and platform credentials** — NetClaw's MCP registrations
(`config/openclaw.json` → `mcpServers`) are translated into Hermes'
`mcp_servers:` block by `scripts/openclaw-to-hermes-mcp.py` (paths made
absolute, `${VAR}` resolved from the shared `.env`, merged non-destructively).
Inspect the result with `hermes mcp list`.

> **Scope:** the runtime choice covers install, onboarding, gateway, MCP
> registration, skills, and credentials. The **n2n/iN2N federation subsystem**
> (mesh daemon, protocol peering, risk federation) is OpenClaw-native and is not
> yet ported to Hermes — the `netclaw` launcher switches only its `tui` entry and
> state-dir base to follow the chosen runtime.

## A Risk of NetClaws (iN2N)

A **risk** is the (real) collective noun for a group of lobsters — and NetClaw is
a lobster. You can now run **a risk of NetClaws**: instead of one monolith
carrying every skill, run a group of **focused, specialized claws** coordinated by
a single **Border Claw**. You talk only to the Border; it routes each request to
the member that owns the capability (a CML claw, a pyATS claw, an Azure claw…) and
returns the result.

- **Focus & token economy** — each member carries a handful of skills, not 190.
- **Least privilege** — each member gets *only* its integration's secrets.
- **One door** — the Border is the single interface, single external identity, and
  single audit trail; members dial it outbound (no ngrok, no mesh, no inbound
  ports — co-located or across clouds). Any provider/model per claw (incl. local
  Ollama). Cold/on-demand members spin up on first use.

At install you pick **standalone**, **Border**, or **Member**. This is the
*internal* counterpart to N2N federation between different operators (eN2N). A
classic standalone NetClaw is just "a risk of one, its own Border."

> **NCFED is documented as an IETF Internet-Draft** — `draft-capobianco-ncfed-00`
> (Experimental), specifying the wire protocol (BGP-multiplexed discrimination,
> 13-octet handshake, framing, eN2N consent + iN2N TOFU trust models) for the IETF
> `agentproto` effort: [`docs/ietf/draft-capobianco-ncfed-00.md`](docs/ietf/draft-capobianco-ncfed-00.md).

> **Claw Certification (feature 060)** closes the eN2N crypto gap: federation
> channels are TLS-encrypted and certificate-authenticated — **domain-verified**
> (ACME/Let's Encrypt via DNS-01, identity bound to a DNS name you own, not the
> tunnel) or **pinned** self-signed TOFU. The Border is its risk's CA so members
> verify the hub (mutual auth); credentials auto-rotate before expiry. Enable with
> `N2N_CERT_MODE=on|enforce`; existing claws upgrade in one command
> (`scripts/patch-claw-certs.sh`). New to peering? See
> [docs/N2N-FEDERATION-GUIDE.md](docs/N2N-FEDERATION-GUIDE.md).

### Production mode — enforced, honest, and durable (feature 057)

`N2N_RISK_MODE=production` **enforces**, fail-closed, rather than merely flagging.
Layered, production-grade security — and posture that never lies:

- **Member sandbox — host-level kernel confinement.** Each member runs as a
  hardened `systemd` unit (`NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, the operator's
  master `.env` made inaccessible, private `/tmp`, and syscall/namespace limits on
  native Linux); on-demand members cold-start in a transient hardened `systemd-run`
  unit. The member keeps its real tools/network but is kernel-confined. *(OpenShell
  containers were evaluated and rejected for live-infra members — empty,
  egress-denied sandboxes; host confinement is what actually works.)*
- **Model-guard — DefenseClaw LLM guardrail proxy.** Model I/O routes through the
  DefenseClaw Go proxy (`:4000`) for prompt/response inspection; member skill/MCP
  sets are DefenseClaw **component-scanned** before they run. If the guard is
  unavailable, delegations fail closed (no silent bypass to a direct provider).
- **Audit — GAIT immutable git trail.** Every delegation/enrollment/removal/
  quarantine is committed to `~/.openclaw/n2n/gait/` (append-only) on both Border
  and member sides, cross-referenced to the SQLite audit.
- **Least-privilege secrets** by construction — each member gets only its
  integration's `.env` slice; the sandbox hides the master `.env`.
- **Honest posture** — `testing` / `production — enforced` / `production — DEGRADED
  (<controls> missing)`; **never** a false enforced claim. Per-control policy:
  containment gap (sandbox / model-guard) **blocks**; audit-only gap (GAIT) **runs
  flagged `audit-degraded`**; `N2N_STRICT_ALL=1` blocks on any gap.
- **Durable runtime** — mesh daemon + always-on members as `systemd --user`
  services (`Restart=always`), generated by `scripts/in2n-services.py`; fault
  isolation distinguishes daemon vs member vs backend.
- **A2A cards** advertise the risk's **posture** and **LLM capability** (model +
  guarded flag) so federated peers see a neighbour's security + reasoning tier.

**Token/context economy:** the monolith loaded ~194 skills + ~37–52 MCP servers
(hundreds–thousands of tool schemas) into *every* turn. A risk runs a lean Border
(**0 domain skills**, ~32 broker tools) that routes to members carrying **~3
specialty skills + 1 vendor MCP** each — roughly a **15–30× reduction in per-claw
tool-schema context**, plus tiered models (Opus Border, Sonnet/Haiku/Ollama
members). See [docs/N2N-RISK.md](docs/N2N-RISK.md#token--context-economy--the-whole-point)
and [specs/057-in2n-production-enforcement](specs/057-in2n-production-enforcement/).

[docs/N2N-RISK-MIGRATION-FOR-PEERS.md](docs/N2N-RISK-MIGRATION-FOR-PEERS.md)

Whatever you pick, the installer then runs a two-phase setup:

**Phase 1: `openclaw onboard`** (OpenClaw's built-in wizard)
- Pick your AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, Vertex, 30+ options)
- Set up the gateway (local mode, auth, port)
- Connect channels (Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Install the daemon service

**Phase 2: `./scripts/setup.sh`** (NetClaw platform credentials)
- Network devices (testbed.yaml editor)
- Platform credentials — **only for the components you installed** (your selection is remembered in `~/.openclaw/netclaw-components.conf`)
- Your identity (name, role, timezone for USER.md)

After setup, start NetClaw:

```bash
openclaw gateway              # terminal 1
openclaw tui                  # terminal 2
```

Reconfigure anytime:
- `openclaw configure` — AI provider, gateway, channels
- `./scripts/setup.sh` — network platform credentials
- `./scripts/install.sh` — add or remove MCP servers (re-run keeps your current selection preselected)

## Enterprise Security (DefenseClaw + OpenShell)

NetClaw includes enterprise-grade security via **Cisco DefenseClaw** and **NVIDIA OpenShell**:

| Layer | Technology | Protection |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Container** | NVIDIA OpenShell | Docker-based sandbox with YAML policies |
| **Guardrails** | Cisco DefenseClaw | LLM inspection, tool call filtering |
| **Scanning** | CodeGuard | Credential detection, injection prevention |
| **Audit** | SQLite + SIEM | Full compliance logging |

### Enable Security

```bash
# During install (recommended)
./scripts/install.sh
# Answer 'y' to "Enable DefenseClaw + OpenShell?"

# Or enable later
./scripts/defenseclaw-enable.sh
```

### Run NetClaw Securely

```bash
# One-command secure startup (recommended)
./scripts/netclaw-secure-start.sh

# Then connect to sandbox:
openshell sandbox connect netclaw
export HOME=/sandbox
openclaw gateway run &
openclaw tui
```

```bash
# Or guardrails only (no container)
defenseclaw setup guardrail --mode action
claw
```

## Visual HUD

<p align="center">
  <img src="ui/netclaw-visual/logos/netclawvisualhud.png" alt="NetClaw Visual HUD — 3D Network Operations Dashboard" width="800">
</p>

NetClaw includes a Three.js 3D operations dashboard that computes its integration and skill inventory live from the codebase (currently 173 MCP integrations and 227 skills) each time it's opened, alongside your device fleet and live BGP peering topology — so the dashboard never drifts out of sync with what's actually installed. Chat with NetClaw directly from the browser, watch integrations light up as tools execute, and inspect every node in the graph. The Canvas/A2UI visualization skill renders inline topology maps, health dashboards, alert cards, change timelines, config diffs, path traces, and health scorecards directly in the chat interface.

```bash
cd ui/netclaw-visual
npm install
npm run dev                   # opens at http://localhost:3000
```

Requires the OpenClaw gateway to be running for live chat (`openclaw gateway run`).
On the NemoClaw attach path the gateway is already inside the sandbox — start
the HUD with [docs/NEMOCLAW-START-NETCLAW.md](docs/NEMOCLAW-START-NETCLAW.md)
instead of a host `openclaw gateway`.

- **Audit** every action in an immutable Git-based trail (GAIT) — there is always an answer to "what did the AI do and why"
- **Track** token consumption and cost in real-time — every interaction displays input/output tokens, USD cost, and GCF savings. Session-level tracking with per-tool breakdown. Powered by Anthropic's `count_tokens()` API with local estimation fallback
- **Optimize** token usage with GCF encoding — all MCP server responses use [GCF](https://gcformat.com) (Graph Compact Format) for 55-83% token savings on network data. Auto-detects graph-shaped data (devices + links/sessions) and uses graph profile with local IDs and edge arrows. Session deduplication tracks previously-sent symbols across calls (91% savings by call 3). Delta encoding sends only changes on re-queries (99% savings). Configurable via `NETCLAW_GCF_MODE`: `full` (default), `graph`, `generic`, or `off`. JSON fallback on any error
- **Remember** across sessions with [MemPalace](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace) — semantic search across all past sessions, temporal knowledge graph for network facts (upgrades, peer changes, maintenance windows) with validity windows, cross-domain navigation between wings, and per-agent diaries. Complements OpenClaw's file-based daily logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) with structured, searchable long-term memory — *"GAIT records what happened. MemPalace remembers why."*
- **Secure** production deployments with [DefenseClaw](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/defenseclaw) — Cisco AI Defense enterprise security: OpenShell kernel-level sandbox (Landlock, seccomp, namespaces), component scanning before execution, CodeGuard static analysis, LLM prompt/completion inspection, runtime guardrails, SQLite audit logging with SIEM export (Splunk HEC, OTLP) for SOC2/PCI-DSS/HIPAA compliance

## OpenClaw Workspace Files

NetClaw ships with the full set of OpenClaw workspace markdown files. These are injected into the agent's system prompt at session start to define its identity, behavior, and operating procedures.

| File | Purpose | Loaded When |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **[SOUL.md](SOUL.md)** | Core personality, CCIE expertise, 12 non-negotiable rules, protocol knowledge base | Every session |
| **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** | Operating instructions: memory system, safety rules, change management workflow, Slack behavior, escalation matrix | Every session |
| **[IDENTITY.md](IDENTITY.md)** | Name, creature type, vibe, emoji — NetClaw's identity card | Every session |
| **[USER.md](USER.md)** | Your preferences, timezone, role, network details — personalization layer (edit this) | Every session |
| **[TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md)** | Local infrastructure notes: device IPs, SSH hosts, Slack channels, site info (edit this) | Every session |
| **[HEARTBEAT.md](HEARTBEAT.md)** | Periodic health checks: device reachability, OSPF/BGP state, CPU/memory, syslog scan | Every heartbeat cycle |

**How they work:** OpenClaw reads these files at session start and injects them under "Project Context" in the system prompt. Each file is capped at 20,000 characters. Sub-agents only receive AGENTS.md and TOOLS.md.

**What to customize:** Edit `USER.md` with your name, timezone, and preferences. Edit `TOOLS.md` with your device IPs, Slack channels, and site information. The rest define NetClaw's behavior and expertise — modify only if you want to change how the agent operates.

## MCP Servers (173)

> Adding one? Follow **[docs/ADDING-AN-MCP.md](docs/ADDING-AN-MCP.md)** and run
> `python3 scripts/reconcile-mcp.py` before pushing — CI enforces it.

> Adding a new MCP server or skill? Run `python3 scripts/verify-inventory-counts.py` before opening your PR — it computes the true skill/MCP counts from the codebase and flags any documentation that has drifted out of sync, so these numbers don't need to be manually recounted (see [spec 047](specs/047-docs-inventory-reconciliation/quickstart.md) for details).

| 88 | Text-to-Speech (TTS) | Built-in (`tts-mcp`), Microsoft Edge TTS | stdio (Python) | Converts NetClaw text responses into MP3 audio for Slack delivery — no API key, no GPU required |
| 89 | Ollama Domain Experts | Built-in (`ollama-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | Delegates structured, domain-specific tasks (config generation, show-output parsing, API query building, SoT validation) to local Ollama models running on your own GPU (10 tools) |
| 90 | Memory MCP | Built-in (`memory-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | Hybrid persistent memory — structured facts (SQLite), semantic search (ChromaDB), decision log, entity relationship graph |

| 94-108 | Check Point Security Suite | Check Point MCP suite (`chkp-*`, 15 servers) | stdio/HTTP (Node) | Quantum, Harmony SASE, gateway management, threat intelligence, and policy insights — 15 individually-registered servers (policy, threat intel, gateway, SASE, malware; see "Check Point Security Integration" section below) (60+ tools) |
| 109 | Chrome DevTools | [ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp) | stdio (Node, npx) | Controlled browser automation/inspection — visualization render QA (screenshot + console check), controller GUI gap-filling, undocumented vendor API discovery via network-request capture, general web-GUI automation. No credentials; auth via one-time manual sign-in into a persistent Chrome profile (~20 tools used across 2 skills) |
| 110 | Chrome DevTools (Watch Mode) | [ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp) | stdio (Node, npx) | Same server, headed (`--headless=false`) instead of headless — a real Chrome window opens wherever NetClaw runs, so an operator can watch it navigate/click/read live (e.g. via Slack: "watch it log into the NetBox demo and create a site"). Works on any host with a display (Mac, Linux desktop, WSL2 with WSLg); no OS-specific code |
| 111 | Computer Use | OpenClaw ClawHub skill (`computer-use`, installed via `openclaw skills install`, not `config/openclaw.json`) | Script-based (bash + xdotool, `DISPLAY=:99`) | Full-desktop automation for legacy tools with no browser or API path — virtual Xvfb+XFCE desktop, 17 mouse/keyboard/screenshot actions, VNC/noVNC live-viewing (loopback-only) for Watch Mode. No credentials (used by 1 skill) |
| 112 | N2N Federation | Built-in (`n2n-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | NetClaw-to-NetClaw federation over the BGP mesh via the new **NCFED** protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0, MCP + A2A semantics) — mutual-consent capability exchange, default-deny remote tool/skill invocation with approvals/budgets/audit, claw-to-claw chat, plus **async task delegation, channel auto-reconnect, endpoint auto-re-announce, and version negotiation** for self-healing reliability. Plus **iN2N — "a risk of NetClaws"**: one operator's group of focused member claws behind a single Border Claw (routing, least-privilege per-member secrets, cold/on-demand members, any provider/model incl. local Ollama), plus **feature 057 production enforcement** (fail-closed OpenShell sandbox + DefenseClaw guard + GAIT git audit, durable systemd services, honest `n2n_posture`/`n2n_faults`). Federated knowledge (feature 064): peers advertise RAG collections as content-free capability-card entries; `n2n_knowledge_query`/`n2n_knowledge_route` get a cited answer from the authoritative peer with no document content leaving its owner. Chroma-to-chroma vector replication (feature 065): with a separate, explicit `knowledge_replica` grant, `n2n_replicate`/`n2n_replicate_resync`/`n2n_replicate_delete` copy a consenting peer's already-embedded collection directly into your own local Chroma store (async job, no re-embedding, refused up front on an embedding-model mismatch or an oversized collection). NetClaw Mobile edge nodes (feature 066): a Border can enroll a phone (Flutter, iOS+Android) via QR-coded single-use token over a new WebSocket-over-TLS transport, reusing the same domain-verified/self-signed credential and pinned-key trust model as every other member — the phone carries no agent runtime, satisfying the base health-monitoring floor via built-in heartbeat/self-status instead of a delivered skill. `n2n_notify_phone` explicitly pushes a text/voice/image message to a connected device (never a blanket mirror of channel traffic); a disconnected device falls back to a platform push notification (FCM/APNs). NetClaw Mobile command channel (feature 067): the reverse direction — a phone's typed, spoken, or QR/deep-link-triggered request is bridged into a real agent turn (the same mechanism claw-to-claw chat already uses) with the operator's own local trust, no new MCP tool, and answered/delegated/routed exactly as a Slack or CLI request would be, with clear attribution of whichever claw actually answered. NetClaw Mobile biometrics and capture (feature 068): also no new MCP tool — approval requests you already trigger now also push to a connected phone for device-biometric approve/deny (`resolve_approval` with `via="biometric"`, same grant/audit semantics), and a phone can both attach a camera/mic capture to its own request and be selected as the target of a Border-initiated `n2n_delegate` when it's the only member advertising that capture capability, via the same capability-routing every other member uses (39 tools). See [N2N-PEERING-NETCLAWS.md](N2N-PEERING-NETCLAWS.md) (external) and [docs/N2N-RISK.md](docs/N2N-RISK.md) (internal/risk) |

| 113 | RAG Knowledge Base | Built-in (`rag-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | Offline agentic document knowledge base — user-uploaded vendor guides/standards/customer docs, hybrid dense+BM25 retrieval with reciprocal rank fusion and local cross-encoder reranking, mandatory citations, structure-aware chunking, opt-in secret-scrubbed snapshots with always-visible staleness. Strictly separate from Memory MCP (10 tools) |
| 114 | Auvik | Built-in | stdio (Python) | Read-only Auvik network monitoring — device and network inventory, alerts, lifecycle/warranty tracking, and performance statistics across MSP tenants (20 tools) |
| 115 | HaloPSA / HaloITSM | Built-in (`halo-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | HaloPSA/HaloITSM (one API): open change requests via a single gated confirm-before-submit write, and review assets and their related tickets, ticket types/fields, clients/sites/users/contracts, and KB for context. OAuth2 client-credentials (18 tools: 17 read + 1 gated write) |
| 116 | Multivendor CLI Driver | Built-in (`multivendor-cli-mcp`) | stdio (Python, dedicated venv) | Nornir/NAPALM/Netmiko reach to ~90 platform families no other NetClaw server covers — MikroTik RouterOS, VyOS, SONiC, Nokia SR Linux, Extreme, Huawei, Dell, Ubiquiti EdgeOS. Read-only by default; writes are single-pathed per platform (refuses config change on Cisco/Junos and names the owning server). Runs from its own virtualenv because napalm/netmiko resolve cryptography 49.x while NCFED's X.509 stack needs the system 46.x (10 tools: 8 read + 2 gated writes) |
| 117 | Cisco PSIRT Advisories | Built-in (`cisco-psirt-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | Cisco PSIRT openVuln API via OAuth2 — is the version a device is actually running affected by a published advisory? Covers IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, FMC, ACI, with severity/CVSS/CVE per advisory. Read-only and device-free (versions come from pyATS or multivendor-cli). Five typed outcomes keep "Cisco published nothing" distinct from "the question was never asked" — an empty list is never reported as *not vulnerable*. De-duplicates by version and caches 6h to live inside the 5/sec + 30/min budget. IOS-XR is not an OSType on this API (404) and is refused rather than attempted (6 tools) |
| 118 | Globalping | [jsDelivr Globalping](https://www.globalping.io) | Remote HTTP (official MCP) | Outside-in network measurement from ~4,800 probes across ~1,390 autonomous systems — ping, traceroute, DNS, MTR and HTTP run *toward* a public target. NetClaw's only vantage point outside its own administrative domain, so it can finally answer "is it us or the internet?". Zero install (hosted endpoint, bearer token). Public endpoints only — private/internal targets are refused locally before any call goes out. Budget 500 probe-measurements/hour, charged per probe (5 measurement tools + budget/probe-availability queries) |
| 119 | Fortinet | Built-in (`fortinet-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | Three planes behind one server — FortiManager policy *intent* (ADOMs, packages, objects, revisions, install preview), FortiGate observed *state* (interfaces, routes, policies, VPN), FortiAnalyzer observed *traffic* (logs, policy activity). Every response carries which plane answered and its scope, so "no logs in the window" is never reported as "the rule is unused". Read-only unless `FORTINET_ALLOW_WRITES=true`, and a write still needs human approval AND an approved change record — two independent gates (21 tools) |
| 120 | BGP & Registry Intelligence | Built-in (`bgp-intel-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | RPKI origin validation, RDAP registry ownership and abuse contacts, PeeringDB interconnection, RIPEstat routing visibility, RIPE Atlas anchors. Five public unauthenticated sources — **no credentials anywhere**. The other half of the external plane: Globalping *measures* toward a target, this *looks up* who owns it and whether an announcement is authorised. RPKI `not-found` means no ROA exists and is **not** a finding — most of the internet is unsigned. Self-imposed 4 req/s sliding window against volunteer-funded infrastructure (10 tools) |
| 121 | Document Generation | Built-in (`document-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | The deliverable layer: change-record `.docx`, interface-audit `.xlsx`, executive `.pptx`, and filling existing PDF forms — from real NetClaw data, not typed by hand. No credentials; writes files and touches no device and no ticket. Every value must arrive tagged with its source, so a missing figure renders as `NOT AVAILABLE — <reason>` and never as a blank cell; a value without a source is refused. Per-element provenance and a Sources section in every file, stamped at one chokepoint and GAIT-audited. Office templates are refused (scratch-only); output is timestamped and never overwritten (6 tools) |
| 122 | Zabbix SNMP-Poller NMS | Built-in (`zabbix-mcp`, vendored [mpeirone/zabbix-mcp-server](https://github.com/mpeirone/zabbix-mcp-server), GPL-3.0) | stdio (Python, dedicated venv) | The **polled-history layer** — everything else NetClaw sees arrives when something happens (syslog, traps, flows); this is the only source that answers *what was it doing over time*. Metric history with automatic routing between raw values and hourly trends, current and historical problems with duration, device availability with transitions, and monitored inventory. Read-only, enforced twice: NetClaw forces `READ_ONLY=true` because the upstream launcher inverts that default, plus a destructive-method deny-list that holds even with read-only disabled. Runs from its own virtualenv — it needs fastmcp 3.x while five other servers pin `<3`. Two silent-wrong-answer traps (the value-type default; raw history ageing into trends) are documented as a procedure in the skills, because a generic passthrough has no chokepoint (3 tools) |
| 123 | Kubernetes (read-only) | Built-in (`k8s-mcp`, vendored [containers/kubernetes-mcp-server](https://github.com/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server), Apache-2.0) | stdio (pinned Go binary) | Reads the Kubernetes **object model** where `kubeshark` reads packets — pods, services, ingresses, EndpointSlices and **NetworkPolicies**. Strictly read-only; Secrets denied at two layers; no mutation reachable. Trimmed to 7 tools / 1,643 tokens because the upstream default is 21 / 5,716 and busts the manifest ceiling. A pinned, checksummed static Go binary, so it cannot collide with the `fastmcp<3` pins. Carries a discipline the API forces: **an empty list is not evidence of absence** — and on insufficient RBAC the upstream silently narrows a cluster-wide query to one namespace with no error, which for NetworkPolicy review is an audit lie. Mitigated by a mandated cluster-wide-read ServiceAccount plus a skill preflight (7 tools) |
| 124 | Zeek + Suricata NSM | NetClaw-authored (`mcp-servers/nsm-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | **Offline PCAP network-security monitoring, read-only** — Zeek 8.2.1 session/protocol metadata and Suricata 8.0.6 signature alerting, both from digest-pinned containers. 6 tools / 934 tokens. Every response carries detection posture: Suricata reporting 0 alerts with 0 signatures loaded is reported as an inert detector, never as clean traffic |
| 125 | DuckDB Analysis | NetClaw-authored (`mcp-servers/analysis-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | **Read-only SQL over exported network data** — Zeek logs, Suricata `eve.json`, generated reports. 3 tools. Sandboxed by DuckDB itself: datasets are materialised, then `enable_external_access=false` + `lock_configuration=true` close every filesystem and network path irreversibly, so the memory, RAG, federation and GAIT stores are unreachable by construction rather than by pattern matching |
| 126 | Redfish BMC | NetClaw-authored (`mcp-servers/redfish-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | **Out-of-band hardware visibility, read-only** — power state, component health, thermal and power, BMC firmware, SEL logs across iDRAC/iLO/XClarity/Supermicro. 6 tools / 728 tokens. Answers "is the box dead or is it the network": every response carries a verdict stating what the reading establishes, and an unreachable BMC can never be reported as a downed host. No power control — `#ComputerSystem.Reset` is deliberately unimplemented |
| 127 | Lantronix Percepxion | [Lantronix/percepxion-mcp-server](https://github.com/Lantronix/percepxion-mcp-server) | stdio (Python, dedicated venv) | **Fleet-wide OOB console-server management, external/on-demand** — device inventory, firmware compliance/rollout, config mgmt, Smart Groups, security audit, async CLI dispatch with output retrieval across the Percepxion SaaS platform (37 tools). Actively co-developed by Lantronix, not vendored — see [spec 104](specs/104-percepxion-oob-integration/spec.md) |
| 128 | Lantronix SLC direct | [Lantronix/slc-mcp-server](https://github.com/Lantronix/slc-mcp-server) | stdio (Python, dedicated venv) | **Direct, synchronous single-device OOB console-server access, external/on-demand** — port status, session management, synchronous CLI output, cellular status against individual SLC9000/SLC8000 console servers (37 tools). Same repo family and venv reasoning as Percepxion above — see [spec 104](specs/104-percepxion-oob-integration/spec.md) |
| 129 | ComfyUI | [shawnrushefsky/comfyui-mcp](https://github.com/shawnrushefsky/comfyui-mcp) | stdio (Node.js) | AI image generation backend for the `comfyui-topology-viz` skill — model discovery, built-in text-to-image template selection, async workflow submission and polling against a self-hosted ComfyUI instance (41 tools; this skill uses a subset: `get_status`, `list_models`, `search_templates`, `get_template`, `run_workflow`, `get_task_result`) |
| 130 | Topology Diagram | NetClaw-authored (`mcp-servers/topology-diagram-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | **Federated topology viz, Stage A** (spec 121) — deterministic, correct-by-construction network diagram rendering (real role icons, real labels, real connections; networkx + Pillow, no diffusion model) from a topology snapshot. One tool: `render_structural`. Runs on the `johns-risk/viz` federation member, invoked from Border via `n2n/tools/call` — never in-process on Border |
| 131 | Image Style | NetClaw-authored (`mcp-servers/image-style-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | **Federated topology viz, Stage B** (spec 121) — applies an image-edit diffusion model (Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 GGUF, pending the FR-015 fidelity spike) to restyle Stage A's already-correct diagram without altering structure. One tool: `style_image`. Talks to ComfyUI directly via REST (not through `comfyui-mcp`'s known-broken task tracker). Same member as Stage A |
| 132 | World Labs Marble | NetClaw-authored (`mcp-servers/worldlabs-marble-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | **AI-augmented fantastical topology viz** (spec 122) — thin, fully stateless proxy to World Labs' Marble world-generation API. Three tools: `generate_world` (the one credit-spending operation, guarded by a required `user_confirmed` argument), `check_generation_status`, `get_world` (durable fallback for an expired operation record). Runs standalone on Border, no federation member required. Explicitly decorative — reuses `topology-diagram-mcp`'s accurate diagram as the authoritative artifact, never a replacement for it |
| 133 | Astra Live Twin MCP | Built-in (`astra-twin-mcp`) | stdio (Python) | Read-only live digital twin collector for lab topologies — validates lab allowlist at startup, polls pyATS MCP (`pyats_list_devices`, `pyats_run_show_command`) with no device-write capability, serves `get_snapshot` / `get_deltas` / `get_status` to drive continuous Three.js HUD updates |
| 134 | Topolograph | [Vadims06/topolograph-mcp-server](https://github.com/Vadims06/topolograph-mcp-server) | HTTP (remote) | **OSPF/IS-IS link-state and BGP topology analysis, read-only** — reasons over the whole area's LSDB from a stored Topolograph snapshot: shortest/backup path, per-area nodes/edges with role flags, edge and node failure simulation, MPLS-TE/CSPF feasibility, a topology-change event timeline, plus BGP speakers/sessions/route search, VRF/VPN inventory, and BGP-to-IGP graph binding (27 read tools). Remote HTTP against the operator's own Topolograph instance (`TOPOLOGRAPH_MCP_URL`), bearer `TOPOLOGRAPH_API_TOKEN`. Not vendored — fronts an operator-run API developed upstream. The server runs `TOPOLOGRAPH_MCP_READ_ONLY=true`, so mutation tools (`upload_graph`, `*_lsp`) are absent from `tools/list`; NetClaw scopes further with `defenseclaw tool allow`. See [spec 119](specs/119-topolograph-mcp-onboarding/spec.md) (IGP) and [spec 120](specs/120-topolograph-bgp-mcp-onboarding/spec.md) (BGP) |

Org inventory, licensing, device and client listing, group policies, admins, alert settings, config change audit. No writes exist upstream, so there is no CRUD and no lifecycle control. |
| **nsm-ids-triage** | Suricata IDS alert triage from a packet capture (read-only): signature alerts with severity filtering, ruleset age, and detection posture. Zero alerts is only a clean result when the signature count is non-zero — stock Suricata loads 0 signatures and alerts on nothing while exiting 0. |
| **nsm-session-pivot** | Zeek session and protocol pivot from a packet capture (read-only): connection table, service filtering, and following a connection `uid` into dns/http/ssl/weird logs. Zeek discards invalid-checksum packets by default, so a missing protocol log is never read as absent traffic. |
| **network-data-analysis** | Ad-hoc read-only SQL (DuckDB) over exported network data: cross-log joins on Zeek `uid`, top-talker and signature aggregation, counting questions a per-log view cannot answer. Capped results are reported as pages, never totals. |
| **hardware-health-check** | Out-of-band hardware health via Redfish BMC (read-only): power state, component and thermal/PSU health, firmware inventory, SEL triage. Separates "the box is dead" from "the network to the box is dead" — a BMC timeout is never reported as a downed host, and an empty SEL is not a clean bill of health. |

| **cisco-psirt-advisories** | Built-in (`cisco-psirt-mcp`) | Cisco PSIRT advisory checks for a running version — IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, FMC, ACI. Two-step chain: read the version with pyATS/multivendor-cli, then check it. Teaches the distinction that matters — "no advisories" is not "not vulnerable", and a parse failure means nothing was checked. Per-family version formats contradict each other; IOS-XR is unsupported by the API |
| **globalping-external-checks** | [Globalping](https://www.globalping.io) (remote MCP) | Measure a public endpoint from thousands of global probes — external reachability, regional latency comparison, DNS propagation. Teaches the three-way distinction that matters: "no probes matched" means nothing was tested, "0 of N successful" means genuinely unreachable, and internal targets are refused before anything leaves the building |
| **subnet-calculator** | [SubnetCalculator MCP](https://github.com/automateyournetwork/GeminiCLI_SubnetCalculator_Extension) | IPv4 + IPv6 subnet calculator — VLSM planning, wildcard masks, address classification, RFC 6164 /127 links |

| **threejs-network-viz** | Vendored Three.js r147 + [gregkop/sketchfab-mcp-server](https://github.com/gregkop/sketchfab-mcp-server) (optional) | Browser-based 3D network topology visualization — the recommended alternative to `blender-3d-viz`/`ue5-network-viz` when you don't want a desktop engine: single self-contained HTML file, no build/server/GPU required. True interface-as-child-of-device scene graph, interface-to-interface link cables, role/state color legend, composes any of 8 topology-source integrations or a freeform description, optional CC0-verified real-3D-model stencils |
| **comfyui-topology-viz** | [shawnrushefsky/comfyui-mcp](https://github.com/shawnrushefsky/comfyui-mcp) (Node), `topology-diagram-mcp`, `image-style-mcp` | AI-generated stylized still images of a network topology — same request phrasing, now internally routed (spec 121) to a federated two-stage pipeline (deterministic structural diagram + diffusion restyle, on the `johns-risk/viz` member) with spec 120's original Flux+ControlNet pipeline as the automatic fallback for freeform requests or member unreachability. Response indicates which path (`federated`/`federated_partial`/`fallback`) produced the image. Checks installed checkpoints before generating and reports distinctly when none are usable; no NetClaw-imposed generation timeout; one job in flight at a time. Stills only in v1 — video/animation is a likely follow-on |
| **worldlabs-topology-viz** | `worldlabs-marble-mcp`, `topology-diagram-mcp` (reused unmodified) | AI-augmented, explorable 3D "world" visualization of a real network topology via World Labs Marble (spec 122) — free, instant, no-cost themed prompt preview (repeatable with a different theme) plus, only after explicit two-layer confirmation (conversational and code-level), a real credit-spending world generation. Explicitly decorative: every result carries a fixed statement that it is an artistic interpretation, never an accurate diagram, alongside the real structural diagram it was derived from. Confirmed generation attempts are GAIT-audited |

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **browser-viz-verify** | Verify a NetClaw-generated visualization (three.js, canvas, drawio, UML, markmap) actually renders correctly — screenshot, console-error check, optional Lighthouse audit. Local files only, no external site |
| **browser-gui-inspect** | Controller-agnostic browser automation — fill gaps in controller skills whose REST API lacks a GUI-only report, discover undocumented vendor APIs via network-request capture, and automate one-off interactions with web tools that have no API integration |

### Desktop Automation Skills (1)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **desktop-gui-inspect** | Full-desktop automation for legacy tools with no browser or API path — a Java-based NMS client, a vendor's Windows-only utility, a terminal emulator with no scriptable interface. Drives OpenClaw's `computer-use` skill (virtual Xvfb+XFCE desktop, 17 mouse/keyboard/screenshot actions) to read/confirm/search state, with VNC/noVNC Watch Mode. Read/confirm only — never a config-change mechanism |

#### Watching NetClaw Live (Watch Mode)

Both `browser-gui-inspect` and `desktop-gui-inspect` support Watch Mode — just ask (e.g. "watch mode: open a terminal and SSH into R1"). What you connect to depends on which one is running:

- **Chrome DevTools Watch Mode** opens a real, visible Chrome window wherever NetClaw's host has a display (macOS, Linux desktop, WSL2 with WSLg) — no viewer needed, the window just appears.
- **Computer Use Watch Mode** drives a *virtual* desktop, so you connect to it explicitly:
  - **Same machine as NetClaw**: open `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html` in a browser (leave the password field blank unless you set one), or point any VNC client at `localhost:5900`.
  - **Different machine**: tunnel first, then connect locally — `ssh -L 6080:localhost:6080 <netclaw-host>`, then open `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html`. Never expose port 5900 or 6080 directly; the installer enforces loopback-only binding for exactly this reason (see `specs/050-computer-use-desktop/research.md` R5).
  - You can watch passively or click/type directly into the noVNC window to take over — e.g. to complete a one-time interactive login NetClaw can't do itself.

### Flow & Event Telemetry Skills (5)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **gnmi-telemetry** | gNMI streaming telemetry for multi-vendor devices — structured YANG model paths, real-time subscriptions, ITSM-gated config changes, YANG capability browsing |

### Kubernetes Skills (3)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **k8s-network-policy** | NetworkPolicy review with the `can-i` preflight that keeps an empty result from being reported as absence. States the consequence Kubernetes forces: no policy means **all traffic is permitted** |
| **k8s-service-path** | Service → selector → pods → EndpointSlices → readiness, plus Ingress routing. "No endpoints" is a symptom, never a diagnosis; every link is marked checked or not checked |
| **k8s-workload-inventory** | Pods with node, phase and readiness, plus events. Running is not Ready, non-running pods are never omitted, and "no events" may mean they aged out |

### SNMP-Poller NMS Skills (3)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **zabbix-metrics-history** | Polled metric history over any window, routed automatically between raw values and hourly trends. Carries the procedure that prevents the two silent-wrong-answer traps — call `item.get` before `history.get`, never accept the default value type, never mix types in one call |
| **zabbix-problem-review** | Current and historical problems with severity, host, onset and **duration**. An empty problem list is a positive finding; an unreachable NMS is a failure to look, and the two never read the same |
| **zabbix-availability** | Device availability with transitions and flap counts, plus monitored inventory. Reports what the poller observed and when — never "the device is down" |

### Document Generation Skills (2)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **document-generation** | The `document-mcp` tool surface — `.docx`/`.xlsx`/`.pptx` from tagged values, PDF form inspection and filling, and the no-fabrication discipline. A value with no source is refused; a missing value renders as `NOT AVAILABLE`, never as a blank |
| **network-report-documents** | The four NetClaw compositions — change record from a real ServiceNow CR plus device state, interface/config audit workbook, executive summary deck with an embedded diagram, and filling a required PDF form |

### Visualization Skills (2)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **canvas-network-viz** | Canvas/A2UI inline network visualizations — topology maps, health dashboards, alert cards, change timelines, config diffs, path traces, health scorecards rendered directly in the chat interface |
| **ue5-network-viz** | Unreal Engine 5 3D network digital twin — interface-level actors, live color legend, traffic/health/SNMP-trap-driven state, ping/traceroute animation, historical playback |

### Platform Operations Skills (2)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **defenseclaw-ops** | Manage DefenseClaw enterprise security — scan components, manage tool permissions, view alerts, configure guardrails |
| **token-tracker** | Track and display token consumption and cost for every NetClaw interaction |

### ITSM Skills (1)

| Skill | Purpose |

## Cisco WebEx Integration

> **Important:** WebEx is **not** a built-in OpenClaw channel. Unlike Slack (which ships as a first-party OpenClaw provider using WebSocket), WebEx is an **add-on** that uses the community [`@jimiford/webex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jimiford/webex) OpenClaw channel plugin. This plugin delivers inbound messages via **webhooks** — WebEx POSTs to a public HTTPS endpoint whenever someone @mentions your bot. That means you need a publicly reachable URL (ngrok for local development, a real domain for production).

NetClaw's WebEx support is **bidirectional**:

| Direction | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Outbound** (NetClaw → WebEx) | Direct REST API calls to `https://webexapis.com/v1/messages` using the bot token. Supports plain text, markdown, Adaptive Cards, file attachments, threaded replies. |
| **Inbound** (WebEx → NetClaw) | The `@jimiford/webex` plugin registers a webhook with WebEx. When a user @mentions the bot, WebEx POSTs to your webhook URL, the plugin routes it to OpenClaw, and the agent responds. |

### Prerequisites

- A **Cisco WebEx account** (free or paid)
- **Node.js 18+** and **OpenClaw 2026.3.x** (already installed if you ran `install.sh`)
- **ngrok** (free tier works) — only required for local/development setups where the gateway is not publicly reachable

### Step 1: Create a WebEx Bot

1. Go to [developer.webex.com/my-apps](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps)
2. Click **Create a New App** → **Create a Bot**
3. Fill in:
   - **Bot Name:** `NetClaw` (or whatever you prefer)
   - **Bot Username:** e.g. `YourOrg_NetClaw` (must be unique)
   - **Icon:** upload one or use a default
   - **Description:** `CCIE-level AI network engineering agent`
4. Click **Add Bot**
5. **Copy the Bot Access Token** — this is shown only once (you can regenerate it later)
   - The token looks like: `ZTA2MmM2MjMt...` (long base64 string)
   - Bot tokens are **long-lived** and do not expire

### Step 2: Add the Bot to a WebEx Space

1. In the WebEx app, create or open a space (e.g., "NetClaw Alerts")
2. Click the space name → **People** → **Add people**
3. Search for your bot by its username (e.g., `YourOrg_NetClaw@webex.bot`) and add it
4. **Copy the Room ID** — you'll need this for environment variables. Get it from:
   - The [WebEx API docs](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/rooms/list-rooms) → **Try It** → find your space in the results
   - Or use: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" https://webexapis.com/v1/rooms`

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

You can set these either by running `./scripts/setup.sh` (interactive wizard) or by manually editing `~/.openclaw/.env`:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes | Bot Access Token from Step 1 |
| `WEBEX_ALERTS_ROOM_ID` | Optional | Default space for CRITICAL/HIGH alert delivery |
| `WEBEX_REPORTS_ROOM_ID` | Optional | Default space for scheduled report delivery |
| `WEBEX_INCIDENTS_ROOM_ID` | Optional | Default space for incident declarations |
| `WEBEX_WEBHOOK_URL` | For inbound | Your public webhook URL (see Step 4) |
| `WEBEX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Optional | HMAC-SHA1 secret for webhook signature verification |

**Option A — Run the setup wizard:**
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```
The wizard prompts for the bot token, room IDs, webhook URL, and webhook secret.

**Option B — Edit `.env` directly:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.openclaw/.env
WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN=ZTA2MmM2MjMtMTM3Ny00ZTA0LTgz...
WEBEX_ALERTS_ROOM_ID=Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3Vybjp...
WEBEX_REPORTS_ROOM_ID=Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3Vybjp...
WEBEX_INCIDENTS_ROOM_ID=Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3Vybjp...
```

> **Outbound-only stops here.** If you only need NetClaw to *send* alerts and reports to WebEx (not receive @mentions), you're done. The WebEx skills will use the bot token and room IDs to post messages via the REST API. Skip to Step 7 to test.

### Step 4: Set Up ngrok (Required for Inbound)

WebEx delivers inbound messages via webhooks — it POSTs to a URL you provide. Your OpenClaw gateway listens on `localhost:18789`, which isn't publicly reachable. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) creates a secure tunnel from a public HTTPS URL to your local gateway.

1. **Install ngrok** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ngrok
   # Linux
   curl -sSL https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz | sudo tar xz -C /usr/local/bin
   # Or visit https://ngrok.com/download
   ```

2. **Sign up** at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) (free tier is sufficient) and set your auth token:
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

3. **Start the tunnel:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 18789
   ```

4. **Copy the HTTPS URL** from the ngrok output:
   ```
   Forwarding  https://a1b2-203-0-113-42.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:18789
   ```

5. Your webhook endpoint is:
   ```
   https://a1b2-203-0-113-42.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/webex/default
   ```

> **ngrok free tier caveat:** The URL changes every time you restart ngrok. After restarting, update the `webhookUrl` in `openclaw.json` and restart the gateway. For production, use a stable HTTPS domain or an ngrok paid plan with a fixed subdomain.

### Step 5: Install the WebEx Channel Plugin

The `@jimiford/webex` plugin adds WebEx as a bidirectional channel to OpenClaw (similar to how Slack is built in):

```bash
openclaw plugin install @jimiford/webex
```

Then configure `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. Add these sections (merge with your existing config):

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "webex": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
      "webhookUrl": "https://a1b2-203-0-113-42.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/webex/default",
      "dmPolicy": "allow"
    }
  },
  "plugins": {
    "allow": ["webex"],
    "entries": {
      "webex": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
          "webhookUrl": "https://a1b2-203-0-113-42.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/webex/default",
          "dmPolicy": "allow"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual bot token and the ngrok URL with your actual URL.

### Step 6: Enable Cross-Provider Messaging (Optional)

By default, OpenClaw enforces **provider isolation** — a session started from WebEx cannot send messages to Slack, and vice versa. If you want NetClaw to relay messages between channels (e.g., ask NetClaw in WebEx to post an alert to Slack), add this to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "message": {
      "crossContext": {
        "allowWithinProvider": true,
        "allowAcrossProviders": true,
        "marker": {
          "enabled": true,
          "prefix": "[from {channel}]"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Cross-provider messages are tagged with a `[from webex]` or `[from slack]` prefix so recipients know the origin.

### Step 7: Start and Test

1. **Make sure ngrok is running** (if using inbound):
   ```bash
   ngrok http 18789
   ```

2. **Start the gateway:**
   ```bash
   openclaw gateway run
   ```

3. **Verify the WebEx provider starts.** You should see these lines in the gateway log:
   ```
   [webex] [default] starting Webex provider (webhook mode)
   [webex] [default] webhooks registered
   [webex] [default] HTTP webhook handler registered at /webhooks/webex/default
   [webex] [default] Webex provider running (webhook mode — waiting for messages)
   ```
   If you see `auto-restart attempt`, something is wrong — check your token and webhook URL.

4. **Test outbound** — from Slack (or the web chat), ask NetClaw to send a message to WebEx:
   ```
   Send a hello world message to the WebEx alerts space
   ```

5. **Test inbound** — in WebEx, @mention the bot:
   ```
   @NetClaw what skills and MCPs do you have?
   ```
   The bot should respond directly in the WebEx space.

### WebEx Skills Reference

WebEx skills use the [WebEx REST API](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/getting-started) with [Adaptive Cards v1.3](https://developer.webex.com/messaging/docs/buttons-and-cards) for rich interactive formatting, the People API for user-aware routing, and threaded messages via `parentId` for investigation workflows.

| API Endpoint | Used For |
|-------------|----------|
| `POST /v1/messages` | Send text, markdown, and Adaptive Cards to spaces |
| `GET /v1/rooms` | List and create spaces for incidents |
| `GET /v1/people/me` | Bot identity and display name |
| `GET /v1/memberships` | Check who is in a space |
| `POST /v1/webhooks` | Register webhook targets (handled automatically by the plugin) |

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No `[webex]` line in gateway log | Plugin not installed or not enabled | Run `openclaw plugin install @jimiford/webex` and check `openclaw.json` has `plugins.allow: ["webex"]` |
| `auto-restart attempt` loop | Provider starts but immediately exits | Check bot token is valid; check ngrok is running and URL matches config |
| @mention in WebEx gets no response | Webhook not reaching gateway | Verify ngrok is running, URL in `openclaw.json` ends with `/webhooks/webex/default`, and WebEx webhook is registered (check at developer.webex.com → Webhooks) |
| `Cross-context messaging denied` | Provider isolation blocking cross-channel sends | Add `tools.message.crossContext.allowAcrossProviders: true` to `openclaw.json` |
| `404` on webhook POST | URL path mismatch | The gateway listens at `/webhooks/webex/default` (not `/webhooks/webex`) — make sure the `/default` suffix is in your webhook URL |

---

## Cloud

NetClaw extends into public cloud infrastructure. Each cloud provider gets its own set of MCP servers and skills, all driven from the same Slack/WebEx/chat interface as on-prem operations.

### AWS

**6 MCP servers, 5 skills** — networking, monitoring, security, cost, and architecture visualization.

#### Credentials

You need an IAM user with programmatic access. Three values:

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` | IAM access key ID |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/...` | IAM secret access key |
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` | Default region for API calls |

Or use a named AWS CLI profile instead: `AWS_PROFILE=my-profile`

Run `./scripts/setup.sh` — the wizard prompts for all three values.

#### IAM Policy (Minimum Permissions)

Create an IAM policy with these permissions and attach it to your NetClaw IAM user:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "NetClawNetworkReadOnly",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Describe*",
        "ec2:GetTransitGateway*",
        "ec2:SearchTransitGateway*",
        "networkmanager:Get*",
        "networkmanager:List*",
        "networkmanager:Describe*",
        "network-firewall:Describe*",
        "network-firewall:List*",
        "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "NetClawCloudWatch",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
        "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
        "cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms",
        "logs:StartQuery",
        "logs:GetQueryResults",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "NetClawIAMReadOnly",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:Get*",
        "iam:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "NetClawCloudTrail",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudtrail:LookupEvents",
        "cloudtrail:GetTrailStatus",
        "cloudtrail:DescribeTrails"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "NetClawCostExplorer",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ce:GetCostAndUsage",
        "ce:GetCostForecast",
        "ce:GetDimensionValues"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "NetClawDiagram",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Describe*",
        "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
        "rds:Describe*",
        "lambda:List*",
        "ecs:Describe*",
        "ecs:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### What You Can Do

| Skill | Capabilities |
|-------|-------------|
| `aws-network-ops` | List VPCs, inspect subnets/route tables/NACLs, Transit Gateway routes/attachments/peering, Cloud WAN, VPN tunnel status, Network Firewall rules, flow logs, ENI lookup, IP search |
| `aws-cloud-monitoring` | CloudWatch metrics (VPN tunnel state, NAT GW drops, TGW traffic, ELB health), alarms, Logs Insights queries, VPC/TGW flow log analysis |
| `aws-security-audit` | IAM users/roles/policies (read-only), MFA compliance, access key rotation, CloudTrail API event history, incident investigation |
| `aws-cost-ops` | Spending by service/region/tag, monthly trends, forecasts, anomaly detection, network cost drivers (NAT GW $0.045/GB, TGW $0.02/GB) |
| `aws-architecture-diagram` | Auto-discover infrastructure, render VPC/subnet/TGW topology as PNG/SVG/PDF (requires `graphviz`) |

#### Prerequisites

- AWS account with IAM user (programmatic access)
- `graphviz` for architecture diagrams: `apt install graphviz` or `brew install graphviz`
- `uv` (installed automatically by `install.sh`) for running AWS MCP servers via `uvx`

#### Cost Notes

- **Cost Explorer API**: $0.01 per API request — NetClaw batches queries but be mindful of frequent polling
- **CloudWatch Logs Insights**: Charged per GB scanned — use narrow time ranges
- **All other operations**: Standard AWS API calls (no additional charge beyond normal AWS usage)

### GCP (Google Cloud Platform)

**4 remote MCP servers, 3 skills** — compute, monitoring, and logging.

#### Key Difference: Remote HTTP Servers

Google Cloud MCP servers are **remote HTTP endpoints hosted by Google** — nothing to install locally. They use Streamable HTTP transport and authenticate via OAuth 2.0 / Google IAM, not API keys.

| MCP Server | Endpoint | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Compute Engine | `https://compute.googleapis.com/mcp` | 28 tools — VMs, disks, templates, instance groups, snapshots, reservations |
| Cloud Monitoring | `https://monitoring.googleapis.com/mcp` | 6 tools — time series metrics, alert policies, active alerts, metric discovery |
| Cloud Logging | `https://logging.googleapis.com/mcp` | 6 tools — log search, VPC flow logs, firewall logs, audit logs, buckets |
| Resource Manager | `https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/mcp` | 1 tool — project discovery (prerequisite for other servers) |

#### Credentials

You need a Google Cloud project and either a service account or user credentials:

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | `my-project-123` | Your Google Cloud project ID |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | `/path/to/key.json` | Path to service account key JSON file |

Or use `gcloud` CLI for user-based auth: `gcloud auth application-default login`

Run `./scripts/setup.sh` — the wizard prompts for project ID and optional service account key path.

#### IAM Roles (Minimum Permissions)

Grant these roles to your service account or user:

| Role | What It Grants |
|------|---------------|
| `roles/compute.viewer` | Read-only access to all Compute Engine resources |
| `roles/monitoring.viewer` | Read-only access to Cloud Monitoring metrics and alerts |
| `roles/logging.viewer` | Read-only access to Cloud Logging log entries |
| `roles/resourcemanager.projectViewer` | Read-only access to project metadata |

For write operations (create/delete VMs via Compute Engine MCP), add `roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1` — but use ServiceNow CR gating for any changes.

#### What You Can Do

| Skill | Capabilities |
|-------|-------------|
| `gcp-compute-ops` | List/create/start/stop/delete VMs, inspect disks and templates, manage instance groups, discover machine types and images, check reservations and commitments |
| `gcp-cloud-monitoring` | Query time series metrics (CPU, network, disk), list alert policies and active violations, discover available metric types |
| `gcp-cloud-logging` | Search log entries (VPC flow logs, firewall logs, audit logs), discover available logs, inspect log buckets and views |

#### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud project with APIs enabled (Compute Engine, Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging)
- Service account key JSON file, or `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated
- No local install required — servers are hosted by Google

#### Cost Notes

- **Cloud Logging**: Charged per GB scanned beyond 50 GB/month free tier
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Free for GCP metrics; custom metrics charged per time series
- **Compute Engine API calls**: No additional charge

#### Networking Gap

GCP's MCP servers currently cover Compute Engine (VMs) but **not the VPC fabric** — there are no MCP tools for VPC subnets, firewall rules, Cloud VPN, Cloud Interconnect, or Cloud Router. Google is adding more MCP servers regularly, so VPC-specific tools may arrive soon.

### Cisco ThousandEyes

**2 MCP servers, 2 skills** — network monitoring and deep path analysis.

#### Key Difference: Two Complementary MCP Servers

ThousandEyes uses **two MCP servers** that share a single API token:

| MCP Server | Transport | Tools | Strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| Community (`thousandeyes-mcp-community`) | stdio (Python, local) | 9 read-only tools | Core monitoring: tests, agents, path vis, dashboards |
| Official (`api.thousandeyes.com/mcp`) | Remote HTTP (Cisco-hosted) | ~20 tools | Advanced: alerts, outages, BGP, instant tests, endpoint agents, AI |

The community server runs locally via stdio. The official server is a remote HTTP endpoint hosted by Cisco — no local install, accessed via `npx mcp-remote` with Bearer token authentication.

#### Credentials

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TE_TOKEN` | `eyJhbGci...` | ThousandEyes API v7 OAuth bearer token (used by both servers) |

Get your token from: **ThousandEyes > Account Settings > Users & Roles > OAuth Bearer Token**

Run `./scripts/setup.sh` — the wizard prompts for the token.

#### What You Can Do

| Skill | Capabilities |
|-------|-------------|
| `te-network-monitoring` | List tests/agents, query test results, path visualization, dashboard widgets, alerts, events, outages, endpoint agents, anomalies, AI views explanations |
| `te-path-analysis` | Hop-by-hop path analysis (latency, loss, MPLS per hop), BGP route analysis (AS paths, prefix reachability from 300+ global monitors), outage investigation, instant on-demand tests, endpoint VPN diagnostics, BGP hijack/leak detection |

#### Prerequisites

- Cisco ThousandEyes account with API v7 access
- Python 3.12+ (for community MCP server)
- Node.js / npx (for official MCP server via `mcp-remote`)
- Org must not be opted out of ThousandEyes AI features (for official server)

#### Cost Notes

- **Community server tools**: Read-only, no additional cost beyond normal API usage
- **Instant Tests** (official server): Consume ThousandEyes test units — use judiciously
- **API rate limits**: Queries count against your org's ThousandEyes API rate limit

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions. OpenClaw loads them into the agent context at session start.

```markdown
---
name: pyats-health-check
description: "Comprehensive device health monitoring..."
user-invocable: true
metadata:
  { "openclaw": { "requires": { "bins": ["python3"], "env": ["PYATS_TESTBED_PATH"] } } }
---

# Device Health Check

(Step-by-step procedures, show command examples, threshold tables,
 report templates — everything the agent needs to work autonomously)
```

The `metadata.openclaw.requires` block declares binary and environment variable dependencies. The markdown body is the agent's playbook.

Every tool call goes through `scripts/mcp-call.py`, which handles MCP JSON-RPC protocol: initialize, notify, tool call, terminate. No persistent server connections, no port management.

```
python3 mcp-call.py "<server-command>" <tool-name> '<arguments-json>'
```

## Safety

NetClaw enforces non-negotiable constraints at every layer:

**Never guesses device state** — runs a show command or queries NetBox first, always.

**Never touches a device without a baseline** — pre-change state is captured and committed to GAIT before any config push.

**Never skips the Change Request** — ServiceNow CR must exist and be in `Approved` state before execution (except Emergency changes, which require immediate human notification).

**Never runs destructive commands** — `write erase`, `erase`, `reload`, `delete`, `format` are refused at the MCP server level.

**Never auto-quarantines an endpoint** — ISE endpoint group modification always requires explicit human confirmation.

**NetBox is read-write** — NetClaw has full API access to create and update devices, IPs, interfaces, VLANs, and cables in NetBox.

**Always verifies after changes** — if post-change verification fails, the CR is not closed and the human is notified.

**Always commits to GAIT** — every session ends with `gait_log` so the human can see the full audit trail.

---

## GAIT Audit Trail

Every NetClaw session produces an immutable Git-based record of:
- What was asked
- What data was collected (and from where)
- What was analyzed (and what conclusions were reached)
- What was changed (and on what device)
- What the verification result was
- What ServiceNow tickets were created or updated

This is not optional. It is how NetClaw earns trust in production environments.

### What Goes Where

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SOUL.md` | Agent system prompt. Defines personality, CCIE expertise, rules, and workflow orchestration |
| `AGENTS.md` | Operating instructions. Memory system, safety rules, change management, Slack behavior, escalation |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Agent identity card. Name, creature type, vibe, emoji |
| `USER.md` | About you. Preferences, timezone, role, network details. **Edit this.** |
| `TOOLS.md` | Local infrastructure. Device IPs, SSH hosts, Slack channels. **Edit this.** |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Periodic checks. Device reachability, OSPF/BGP state, CPU/memory, syslog. |
| `workspace/skills/` | Skill source files. `install.sh` copies these to `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` |
| `testbed/testbed.yaml` | pyATS device inventory. Referenced by `PYATS_TESTBED_PATH` env var |
| `config/openclaw.json` | Model config template. Contains primary/fallback model settings and pre-registered MCP server definitions |
| `mcp-servers/` | Tool backends cloned by `install.sh`. Gitignored — rebuilt on install |
| `scripts/mcp-call.py` | Handles MCP JSON-RPC protocol: initialize, notify, tool call, terminate |
| `scripts/gait-stdio.py` | Wraps GAIT MCP server for stdio mode (default is SSE) |

## What install.sh Does

The installer is an interactive TUI (pure bash — works over SSH, degrades gracefully without a TTY). Install logic lives in `scripts/lib/` (`common.sh` helpers, `tui.sh` interface, `catalog.sh` component catalog + profiles, `install-steps.sh` one install function per component).

1. **Pick your components** — choose an install profile (Recommended, Cisco, Multivendor, Cloud, Security, Labs, Observability, Minimal, Everything) or hand-pick from all 72 components in a categorized multi-select checklist. Re-running the installer preselects what you already have.
2. **Checks prerequisites** — Node.js >= 18, Python 3, pip3, git, npx — offers to run the install commands for anything missing (apt/dnf/yum/pacman/apk/brew), and handles PEP 668 externally-managed Pythons so pip installs work on modern distros
3. **Installs OpenClaw** — `npm install -g openclaw@latest`
4. **Runs OpenClaw onboard** — AI provider, gateway, channels, daemon service — then verifies the gateway service actually started (systemd unit / LaunchAgent / port probe) and offers a retry with diagnostics if it didn't
5. **Installs the selected MCP servers** — each component clones/pip-installs/pulls exactly what it needs (`./scripts/install.sh --list` shows every component and what it provides)
6. **Deploys skills + workspace files** — copies all skills and the SOUL/AGENTS/IDENTITY/USER/TOOLS/HEARTBEAT files to `~/.openclaw/workspace/`
7. **Writes the component manifest** — your selection is saved to `~/.openclaw/netclaw-components.conf` so `setup.sh` only prompts for credentials that matter
8. **Verifies the installation** — checks each selected component's script/CLI/module actually landed
9. **Prints a summary** — the installed components grouped by category
10. **Offers DefenseClaw** — optional enterprise security layer (Cisco AI Defense + NVIDIA OpenShell)
11. **Launches setup.sh** — network platform credentials for the components you installed

## Testbed Configuration

Edit `testbed/testbed.yaml` to define your network devices:

```yaml
devices:
  R1:
    alias: "Core Router"
    type: router
    os: iosxe
    platform: CSR1kv
    credentials:
      default:
        username: admin
        password: "%ENV{NETCLAW_PASSWORD}"
    connections:
      cli:
        protocol: ssh
        ip: your-device-hostname-or-ip
        port: 22
```

The `%ENV{NETCLAW_PASSWORD}` syntax pulls credentials from environment variables so they stay out of version control.

## Missions for reference

| Mission | Status | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| MISSION01 | Complete | Core pyATS agent, 7 skills, Markmap, Draw.io, RFC, NVD CVE, SOUL v1 |
| MISSION02 | Complete | Full platform — 37 MCP servers, 82 skills (18 pyATS, 9 domain, 3 F5, 3 CatC, 3 M365, 1 GitHub, 1 packet analysis, 5 CML, 1 ContainerLab, 2 NSO, 1 Itential, 1 FMC, 1 SD-WAN, 1 Grafana, 1 Prometheus, 1 Kubeshark, 1 RADKit, 5 Meraki, 2 ThousandEyes, 5 AWS, 3 GCP, 1 JunOS, 1 Arista CVP, 1 UML, 1 protocol participation, 6 utility, 4 Slack), 6 workspace files, SOUL v2 |
| [038-docs-hud-refresh](specs/038-docs-hud-refresh/) | Superseded | First attempt at reconciling drifted skill/MCP counts (targeted 179 skills / 43 MCP servers as of 2026-06-23). Never re-run after 8 later feature branches merged, so counts drifted again — superseded by 047 below. |
| [047-docs-inventory-reconciliation](specs/047-docs-inventory-reconciliation/) | Complete | Reconciled all skill/MCP counts to ground truth (186 skills, 108 MCP integrations) across README/SOUL/SOUL-SKILLS/mcp-servers docs; added `scripts/verify-inventory-counts.py` so this doesn't drift silently again; confirmed Azure, Batfish, GitLab, and NetFlow/IPFIX were already shipped but undocumented in the MCP Servers table. |
| [048-chrome-devtools-browser-inspection](specs/048-chrome-devtools-browser-inspection/) | Complete | Integrated the official `chrome-devtools-mcp` server (Chrome DevTools team) with two new skills — `browser-viz-verify` (screenshot/console QA on NetClaw's own generated visualizations) and `browser-gui-inspect` (controller-agnostic GUI gap-filling, undocumented vendor API discovery via network-request capture, general web-GUI automation, Watch Mode). Registered twice — `chrome-devtools-mcp` (headless, default) and `chrome-devtools-mcp-visible` (headed, per FR-015 — a real Chrome window an operator can watch live, platform-agnostic). Auth via one-time manual sign-in into a persistent Chrome profile — NetClaw never touches credentials. Counts now 188 skills, 110 MCP integrations (verified via `scripts/verify-inventory-counts.py`). |
| [049-merge-modular-installer](specs/049-merge-modular-installer/) | Complete | Merged a community-contributed modular TUI installer (PR #96 by @calcuttin) — `scripts/lib/catalog.sh` (component catalog) + `scripts/lib/tui.sh` + `scripts/lib/install-steps.sh`, replacing the monolithic `install.sh` with a thin dispatcher. Retrofitted spec 048's Chrome DevTools component into the new catalog, backfilled 9 previously undocumented catalog gaps, added `scripts/verify-catalog-coverage.py`, and amended the constitution to 1.2.0 (Principle XI now references the modular installer files). Pushed directly to the contributor's fork branch to preserve attribution. |
| [050-computer-use-desktop](specs/050-computer-use-desktop/) | Complete | Integrated OpenClaw's own ClawHub `computer-use` skill (Xvfb+XFCE virtual desktop, 17 xdotool-driven actions) as a full-desktop automation capability for legacy tools with no browser or API path — new `desktop-gui-inspect` skill (read/confirm only, VNC/noVNC Watch Mode) plus a `computer-use` installer catalog entry. Live testing caught and fixed two real upstream/environment bugs: generated VNC/noVNC systemd units were not loopback-only by default (now patched and verified via `ss -tlnp` on every install, per FR-004) and the installed skill's action scripts were non-executable (`chmod +x` now applied automatically). Counts now 189 skills, 111 MCP integrations (verified via `scripts/verify-inventory-counts.py`). |
| [062-rag-mcp](specs/062-rag-mcp/) | Complete | Added the Agentic RAG Knowledge Base: a fully offline `rag-mcp` FastMCP server (10 tools) where users teach NetClaw by uploading documents via Slack attachment, the new HUD Knowledge panel, or URL (confirmed depth-1 crawl). Structure-aware chunking with breadcrumbs, hybrid dense (bge-small) + BM25 retrieval fused by RRF and reranked by a local cross-encoder, mandatory citations on every retrieved claim, honest-miss behavior with a 3-rounds-per-sub-query budget, HIIL-gated delete/re-index, and opt-in secret-scrubbed snapshots with always-visible staleness. SOUL.md/TOOLS.md/memory-skill updates encode the four-source knowledge hierarchy (parametric / Memory / RAG / live MCP) — the RAG store at `~/.openclaw/rag/` is strictly separate from Memory MCP. 65 offline tests; golden-set evaluation harness ships with the format only (operator supplies real documents). Counts now 191 skills, 113 MCP integrations. |
